## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JQueary](https://jquery.com/) - JS library
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SASS official page

### What I learned

How to get a specific element in js using "this"

```html
<div class="notification__div">
  ...
    ...
      <ion-icon class="card__point" name="ellipse"></ion-icon>
```
```js
$(".notification--unread").click(function(){
    n-- 
    $(this).css("background-color","white")
    $(this).find(".card__point").hide()
    $(".notifications__div").text(`${n}`) 
})
```

### Continued development

Now IÂ´m learning SASS and improving my html/css/js skills

### Useful resources

- [Selectors Optimazing](https://uniwebsidad.com/libros/fundamentos-jquery/capitulo-9/optimizacion-de-selectores) - This helped me to discover the find() in JQuery. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
